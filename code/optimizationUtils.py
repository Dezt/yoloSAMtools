#these methods optimize YOLO txt polygon annotations and replaces them after validating and optimizing them, and removes invalid annotations (Bounding box annotations are returned as is).
#First, optimizePolygonLineAnnotation attempts to remove stairstepping effects from the mask to polygon conversion.
#Then, optimizePolygonLineAnnotation uses the Visvalingam-Wyatt "area preserving" line optimization algorithm (as opposed to distance preserving like Douglas-Peucker algorithm). See:
#https://martinfleischmann.net/line-simplification-algorithms/
#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visvalingam%E2%80%93Whyatt_algorithm
#https://github.com/fitnr/visvalingamwyatt

#NOTE disadvantages of Visvalingam-Wyatt algorithm:
#   - The algorithm does not differentiate between sharp spikes and shallow features, meaning that it will clean up sharp spikes that may be important.
#   - The algorithm simplifies the entire length of the curve evenly, meaning that curves with high and low detail areas will likely have their fine details eroded.
